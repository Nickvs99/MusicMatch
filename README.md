Nick van Santen, project, Minor Programmeren

It can be quite hard to compare music styles with others. Especially when you like a bit of everything or aren't sure to which genres you're actually listening. This webapp is meant to make it easier to compare your music style with others and to create a playlist with songs both users like.

## Features:
- View your music style
    - Most streamed artists
    - Popular genres
- Compare your music style with others
- Create a playlist from these results.
